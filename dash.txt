Built on top of Plotly.js, React, and Flask, Dash ties modern UI elements like dropdowns, sliders and graphs directly to your analytical python code.

Dash apps consist of a Flask server that communicates with front-end React components using JSON packets over HTTP requests.

dash core components - dropdown, check box, sliders , date picker etc.

dash html components - div, heading , paragraph

plotly graph objects as json package

callback decorators are the heart of dash apps which provide interactivity

decorators give additional functionality to the existing functions without making any changes to it

change in inputs in web browser , triggers callbacks .

multi page apps can be created using dash.register_pages and dash.page_containers

dashtools can be used to deploy  dash apps to python anywhere or heroku .

dashtools make deployment very simple.

callback function uses id to map input and output objects.

client side callback copies and stores data,  runs javascript in the browser rather in th eserrver to speed up the process.
